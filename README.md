# Code-Quiz

## Description
The following project titled Code-Quiz has been created as a part of the Adelaide University Coding Bootcamp. I took some inspiration from Kahoot in terms of it's multiple choice question layout and created a quiz of 5 questions surrounding javascript coding. The final score will be saved into a high score table. 

During the project I learn how to use key functionalities within javascript including but not limited to:
- DOM Manipulation
- Creating a timer with the setInterval function
- Data Input
- Click events

Once the 5 questions are completed you score will equal the amount of time left and you will be asked to input your initials.
